# ECE3413_Simulink_Library

This is the Matlab Simulink blocks created for Gear Motor with Encoder (https://www.pololu.com/product/2822) and DualVNH5019 MotorShield from Pololu (https://www.pololu.com/product/2507). It is used for a control course at Temple University. Please feel free to use for other projects.


However, channel A and B of an encoder cannot be connected to pins 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 because they are used by the motor shield.
